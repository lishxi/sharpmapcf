#summary Initial porting steps

= Introduction =

These are the steps followed trying to port SharpMap v2.0 to the .NET Compact Framewok. It's based on the work made by Roger Bedell for the older version of SharpMap. 
The original source code has not been removed, but commented using a preprocessing directive (CFBuild).  

= Procedure =
 * External references
 * Common part with the older port
 * New features to update

== External references ==
References to assemblies to add to the VisualStudio project:

 * System.Drawing
 * System.Data.SqlClient
 * NetTopologySuite
 * ProjNET
 * OGR (for SharpMap.Extensions\Data\Providers\OgrProvider.cs: Using OSGeo.OGR)
 * GeoAPI for Classes SharpMap.Converters.NTS.GeometryConverter (SharpMap.Extensions\Data\Providers\NtsProvider.cs) and SharpMap.Data.Providers.NtsProvider (SharpMap.Extensions\Data\Providers\NtsGeometryConverter.cs) 
 * GDAL (for SharpMap.Extensions\Layers\GdalRasterLayer.cs) (?)
       Add "Using OSGeo.GDAL"
       Change all references from GDAL.xxx to OSGeo.GDAL.XXX

== Removing files/unsuported features ==
Files that will be removed:

 * SharpMap.Data.Providers.Oracle.cs: SharpMap.Extensions\Data\Providers\Oracle.cs No Oracle client in CF.
 * System.Web doesn't exist in CF. A number of items depend on this.
  ** SharpMap\Web\HttpHandler.cs. 
  ** SharpMap\Web\Wms\WmsServer.cs
  ** SharpMap\Web\Wms\WmsException.cs
 * SharpMap\Utilities\Surrogates.cs (No System.Runtime.Serialization)
 * SharpMap\Data\Providers\OleDbPoint.cs Had to remove OleDB provider, no System.Data.OleDb in CF
