#summary Initial porting steps

= Introduction =

These are the steps followed trying to port !SharpMap v2.0 to the .NET Compact Framewok. 
= =  
The original source code has not been removed, but commented using a preprocessing directive (CFBuild).  
For example, there's no System.Runtime.Serialization in CF so we do
{{{
 #if !CFBuild
   using System.Runtime.Serialization;
 #endif
}}}
= Procedure =
 * External references
 * Removing files/unsuported features
 * Common part with the older port
 * New features to update
