#summary Initial porting steps

= Introduction =

These are the steps followed trying to port SharpMap v2.0 to the .NET Compact Framewok. It's based on the work made by Roger Bedell for the older version of SharpMap. 
The original source code has not been removed, but commented using a preprocessing directive (CFBuild).  

= Procedure =
 * External references
 * Common part with the older port
 * New features to update

== External references ==
References to assemblies to add to the VisualStudio project:

 * System.Drawing
 * System.Data.SqlClient
 * NetTopologySuite
 * ProjNET
 * OGR (for SharpMap.Extensions\Data\Providers\OgrProvider.cs: Using OSGeo.OGR)
 * GeoAPI for Classes SharpMap.Converters.NTS.GeometryConverter (SharpMap.Extensions\Data\Providers\NtsProvider.cs) and SharpMap.Data.Providers.NtsProvider (SharpMap.Extensions\Data\Providers\NtsGeometryConverter.cs) 
 * GDAL (for SharpMap.Extensions\Layers\GdalRasterLayer.cs) (?)
       Add "Using OSGeo.GDAL"
       Change all references from GDAL.xxx to OSGeo.GDAL.XXX
